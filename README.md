# Stable diffusion
## Description 

This educational project was made under the guidance of Daniil Merkulov on optimization methods in MIPT. I studied the theory behind diffusion models and stable diffusion architecture. 
I explored methods to run and optimize training (fine-tuning) process in conditions of limited computing power and memory (in my case -- GPU in Google Colab).
